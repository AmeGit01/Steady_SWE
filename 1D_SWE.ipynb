    "## The energy equations\n",
    "As anticipated, the problem is solved through the energy equations, obtained from the momentum equation moltiplying them for the velocity $U$, and assuming the steady state. The equations reads as follows:  \n",
    "$\\frac{dh}{dx} = \\frac{\\beta \\frac{F_r^2}{B} \\frac{\\partial \\Omega}{\\partial x}|_h - j}{1+\\beta F_r^2}$  \n",

    "The new terms needs a brief explanation: $j$ is the friction term, which is defined as $j = \\frac{\\tau _0}{\\rho g R_H}$, it contains the friction $\\tau _0$, the water density $\\rho$, the gravity term $g$, and the hydraulic radius $R_H = \\Omega / P$, with $P$ the wetted perimeter. The term $\\frac{\\partial \\Omega}{\\partial x}|_h$ is related to the non prismaticity of the channel, describe how the wetted area changes according to the geometry. This last term is zero in case of completely rectangular channel, in any case for fixed geometry it is just a coefficient that can be precompute and just considered into the equations. Since the equation will be solved for rectangular channel further simplification may be performed, to do not loose generality it will not, the coefficient accounting for the section irregularity will just setted properly."
